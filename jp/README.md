I think I'll add all prefectures/cities for their individual laws+who proposed them

Slight issues:
1. Currently there seems to be a law against downloading 政党交付金使途等報告書 so you are only allowed to view the contents through browsers. I did ask the government whether say taking a photo or writing down what's in there is allowed which I doubt but for now, 政党交付金使途等報告書 will not be included.
2. There may definitely be a lot of copyright restrictions here which will only allow me to show the processed result and not necessarily all the data scraped
